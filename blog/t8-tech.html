    <h1 id="blog_title">SQL Injection Attacks and How to Deal With Them</h1>

        <p>This week we are rounding out our knowledge in preparation for arriving at Dev Bootcamp. As such we are doing a research on a variety of topics so that we can help teach our fellow students. My topic will be injection attacks, a common type of hack that surprisingly many applications are vulnerable to.</p>
        <p>Injection attacks rely on the fact that computers don't actually look at code like we do. When a programmer examines their code, what they see is a collection of variables, functions, conditionals, and so on, but a computer just sees one long string (not the object type) of characters which it is to interpret. Computers do this by taking advantage of special characters; a string is distinguished by being surrounded by single or double quotes, functions have something that tells the computer where it is done, etc. Normally these marks are perfectly sufficient, although special cases may require steps like "escaping" a character (which tells the computer to interpret something as text rather than as actionable). For instance the user might be prompted for their name, which is then surrounded by quotations marks by the program and everything is good.</p>
        <p>The trouble arises when someone starts typing in stranger inputs. Say I have a SQL query that asks for user input, something like: <code>SELECT Username, Password FROM users WHERE Username = "userinputstring" AND Password = "userinputstring";</code>What happens when the user types in 'Jack" SELECT * FROM users;"'? The program prints out the entire user list, which has the all the passwords and usernames that we were storing. That is not good.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, as I said above, the solutions to this are fairly well examined. The first is to run validation on the input and make sure that the inputs that are being received are reasonable: names don't generally have semicolons, asterisks, or mathematical symbols in them, for instance, and getting rid of them would stop a lot of injection attacks. Next is to attempt to minimize the damage by preventing applications from having access to data that they don't expressly need. Regardless of how the query is structured, if the database refuses to give the information, then the attack has been defeated. Minimizing the user's ability to provide custom text (instead providing lists of inputs to choose from) is also helpful, both because it reduces the amount of typos and the places which the hacker can attack.</p>
