        <p>This week we are rounding out our knowledge in preparation for arriving at Dev Bootcamp. As such we are doing a research on a variety of topics so that we can help teach our fellow students. My topic will be injection attacks, a common type of hack that surprisingly many applications are vulnerable to.</p>
        <p>Injection attacks rely on the fact that computers don't actually look at code like we do. When a programmer examines their code, what they see is a collection of variables, functions, conditionals, and so on, but a computer just sees one long string (not the object type) of characters which it is to interpret. Computers do this by taking advantage of special characters; a string is distinguished by being surrounded by single or double quotes, functions have something that tells the computer where it is done, etc. Normally these marks are perfectly sufficient, although special cases may require steps like "escaping" a character (which tells the computer to interpret something as text rather than as actionable). For instance the user might be prompted for their name, which is then surrounded by quotations marks by the program and everything is good.</p>
        <p>The trouble arises when someone starts typing in stranger inputs. By including those special characters into the input that they give the computer, they can confuse it into actually evaluating a portion of it as code, rather than treating it as a string. Should they have an idea of the structure of the rest of the program (and there generally isn't much variation there) they can make it do anything that they might want it to. Whatever that is, it probably isn't what the programmer wanted.</p>
        <p>There are several solutions to this problem. One is to make sure that the program that is receiving the input has as little access to things as possible. A hacker might be able to get the program to do whatever they want it to, but if the database rejects their query, then they aren't getting any of that information. Another is to limit the use of free-form inputs; if the user has to select their input from a list, they then have to mess with the list before they can give it malicious strings. The final is to check inputs for anything suspicious before actually evaluating the statement. Of course these are all complementary, and ideally a programmer should use all of them.</p>
