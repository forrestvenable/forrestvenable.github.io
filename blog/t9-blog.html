        <p>On the eve of the start of Dev Bootcamp, I have updated my website. It is no longer eyesearing, merely boring and empty. Having some people give me some suggestions was extremely helpful, as I lack virtually any experience on this subject.</p>
        <p>The biggest difficuly has been overcoming this deficit of knowledge. I lack some of even the most basic details that I could build upon, which makes self-study impossible. Things that others can use as tools merely bewilder me. I also lack of the portfolio of resources to draw upon to add to my website (namely pictures).</p>
        <p>This has been a humbling experience, but I hope to remedy this weakness. Regardless of what profession I choose, being able to create and maintain my own website is important. I just wish it was as easy to learn as everything else.</p>
