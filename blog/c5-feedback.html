        <p>At this point I have spent several weeks giving and receiving feedback from others who are also attending Dev Bootcamp. I have learned a lot from this, but I am also still figuring things out. The basics are that we have to work together with various fellow students several times a week to solve programming tasks. After we are done, we write a brief piece of feedback for each other and share it through a service provided by Dev Bootcamp.</p>
        <p>With the experiences I have had so far, I have found that pairing with others has felt clumsy and awkward. What immediate benefits I receive from back and forth of working with someone on something is completely overwhelmed by increased time it takes to get us on the same page. I would undoubtedly be faster working by myself and referring to Google when I have a question then I am when I pair.</p>
        <p>But this does not mean that I think that pairing is stupid or a waste of time, expect these difficulties to continue indefinitely, nor do they frustrate me. Working with others might be slower at the moment, but I am gradually learning how to do it more effectively. I can hardly expect to be an instant master of some new skill, after all, and working with others helps teach me a lot about standards and build a sense of community that will surely be useful in the future</p>
        <p>Regarding the feedback we have been exchanging, I have found it to be universally friendly and polite. Actually figuring out what to do with it is much harder, and I have likewise had a hard time giving useful criticism. I am doing my best to keep what I have been told in mind, and hope that others find at least some value from mine. In general everything involved in this feels very relaxed, though I still find ways to worry about it, as is my nature.</p>
