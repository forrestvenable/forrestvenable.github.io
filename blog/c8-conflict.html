        <p>During my senior year of college, there was a particular classmate of mine who had significantly different views than I did on a variety of subjects. Initially we didn't know each other very well, despite having had classes together for four years, but we both seemed intelligent and we wanted to get to know each other better before we graduated. This was a mistake.</p>
        <p>Just about every discussion we had turned to bitter disagreement. These disagreements significantly hampered the ability of the rest of the students to learn from the classes, as we took up far too much time on issues that were not going to be resolved. As the year drew to a close, we (though I feel like it was mostly me) slowly just decided to not talk about it, and let the classes continue without yet another pointless argument happening.</p>
        <p>While this rendered that particular conflict mostly harmless, it led to a series of situations that I still feel ashamed of, for I was not the only person whom this individual had a bone to pick with. Others also drew his ire and I, in a combination of not wanting to reignite those earlier fights (and the understanding that it was the professors' job to deal with stuff like this) and utter cowardice, chose not to defend them.</p>
        <p>Seemingly as our conflict waned, he grew ever more hostile to certain other students, accusing them of not being worthy of the school or stating sexist bigotry with the defense "I'm just telling it like it is." While I was furious at him for his behavior and commiserated with my classmates over his behavior, I did not confront him over it.</p>
        <p>I do not know if I could confront someone like that in a similar situation, but I know that I should. Bigotry should never be allowed to stand unchallenged and letting it be "someone else's problem" just means that it won't be addressed.</p>
