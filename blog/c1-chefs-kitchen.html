    <h1 id="blog_title">Thoughts on Dev Bootcamps Culture</h1>
    <h2>Week 1 Culture Blog <span id="date">September 16, 2014</span></h2>
    <div id="text_body"> 
        <p>I recently watched <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014">this video</a> discussing the way that one of Dev Bootcamp's founders thinks of Dev Bootcamp's culture.1</p>
        <p>As I have not yet actually attended Dev Bootcamp in person, I obviously cannot corroborate what he says. What I will say is that the ideal that he presents is certainly a positive one, and one that I will try my best to uphold. I have found that my fellow cohort mates are very helpful and kind people and I am sure that I will, in time, make many great friends.</p>
        <p>That said, ideals are one thing and reality is another, I am sure that everyone involved will have bad days where we really just want to get everything done with and don't feel like actually engaging with the challenges. I hope that such days are rare for the rest of my cohort and me, and that the material will be interesting and engaging.</p>
        <p>I am not sure where this will go, but what I have seen so far is hopeful.</p>
