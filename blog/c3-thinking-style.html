        <p>The people at Dev Bootcamp are very interested in having us succeed and are clearly trying to give us every possible resource they can to help us. This includes having us learn about time management and finding out about thinking/learning styles. The concern is that we will be learning a lot in a very short period of time, so getting overwhelmed could easily snowball into outright failure with very little warning.</p>
        <p>In particular they want us to understand our thinking style so that we can keep up and structure our time fittingly. According to the quiz they <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">linked</a> us to I am an Abstract Sequential thinker. This means that I generally think through things rationally, as opposed to using leaps of intuition (which would be Random instead of Sequential) or by using experimentation (which would be Concrete instead of Abstract).</p>
        <p>However my greatest difficulty in this program is less about not being able to grasp the lessons and more about me not having much experience to give me a wider context. This is particularly true in the case of learning design, as I can easily learn how the tools we are using work, yet lack the experience to understand when to use them.</p>
        <p>The reason for this lack of experience is actually pretty simple: when I was in grade school I very much had the impression that I "wasn't a creative person". This was, of course, complete nonsense; I was able to actually be quite artistic at times, but lacking much early experience with it and doing so much better at mathematics and science, telling me that I would never be good at art was not a hard sell. The fact that the Arts and the Sciences are so often portrayed as oppositional to each other in our media certainly contributed too.</p>
        <p>And this brings me to why I dislike the "Thinking Styles" that we are being told to identify with: sure I can find one that fits me, but they feel intellectually claustrophobic, hemming in thought into artificial categories that are more about how one formulates their own identity than any empirical differences. The quiz that I linked to above had questions so superficial that one cannot approach it any other way. From the quiz "Read each set of words and mark the two within each set that best describe you" followed lists of one word adjectives that pick between. How can who I am be expressed through a single word? When Oracle of Delphi gave the command "Know thyself" they certainly didn't expect an answer like "I am an analytical, investigative thinker."</p>
