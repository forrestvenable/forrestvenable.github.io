        <p>This will be the last blog post before I arrive in San Francisco for the onsite intensive! I'm both worried and excited. This week's topic is about asking effective questions. We are supposed to do some research and then apply it to some of the questions that we have seen asked in our online community. Unfortunately I was not paying terribly close attention to the quality of questions being asked, and the idea of going back through a little more than two months of social media posts terrifies me and seems like an extremely inefficient use of time for an, at best, marginal benefit. As such, I will be talking more about generalities I have seen instead of referring to a specific post</p>
        <p>The big thing about questions is to be succinct yet clear. People have plenty of other things on their minds, and few people are going to spend more than a brief glance at your question to see if they have an answer. The more time they have to spend, the more that they will give up. If someone needs to ask for clarification, not only have a significant number of people not responded to your question because they didn't understand you, but the clarification probably won't be seen as your post has since been buried.</p>
        <p>The only problem I really saw in the questions people asked was not including relevant information like the code they are struggling with or the OS they are using. A little experience will help people figure out what is relevant and what is not. All said, this cohort seems quite promising in this regard.</p>
