        <p>I have recently started classes with a training program known as Dev Bootcamp, this initial stage is done remotely over the internet, with it later switching to taking place at their location at, in my case, San Francisco.</p>
        <p>This week's lessons are fairly basic, with the intent being to start building an understanding of the tools we will be using later on. In particular we learned about using "version control" and why we are using Github to store the resulting files.</p>
        <p>The purpose behind us using version control is to help us keep track of what our edits to various files are while others are also editing them and to allow us to rollback any changes that we decide shouldn't be there.</p>
        <p>More specifically we are currently editing in our answers to the various tasks we are assigned to the files the curriculum is stored in, but our instructors (and potentially us, if we find a typo or something) can change the curriculum at any time. Without the system we are using, our answers could be lost and it would be difficult to figure out what the questions we are supposed to answer are.</p>
        <p>Because the instructors and we do not share physical access to the same computers, we are using Github to store those files so that both of us can access them without any difficulty. Github is a hosting service that works to promote "git" version control. By using them, our repositories become viewable as web pages by using an internet browser.</p>
        <p>In practice this is a somewhat artificial obstacle that, I suspect, is being imposed to get us comfortable with git (our chosen form of version control) for later challenges where several of us will need to work together over a period of time.</p>
