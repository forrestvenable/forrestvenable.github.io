        <p>This week we spent our time learning about Ruby Classes. Ruby's classes are methods of collecting variables and methods into easily understood objects. For example, take the following:<code>class Programmer<br>  attr_accessor :name, :age, :languages<br>  def initialize(name,age,*languages)<br>    @name = name<br>    @age = age<br>    @languages = languages.flatten<br>  end<br>end<br></code></p>
        <p>This allows me to create a Programmer that has the Attributes (from "attr_accessor") name, age, and the whatever languages that they know. These values can be accessed and/or changed by typing ".name" or such after anything that has been created as a Programmer object. The actual process of creating one is specified in the "initialize" method which in this case says that the user must define the name and age, and may add however many languages that the Programmer might know. These values are then turned into the variables that would be returned by the ".name" syntax.</p>
        <p>Of course I can define other methods besides initialize. These other methods should probably be logically connected to the class that are part of, but that isn't inherently necessary. Unlike "initialize" (which is called by Classname.new()) they are called by .methodname(). The advantage of attaching methods to a class is that it gives easy access to the class's variables and is more easily associated with that class in the rest of the code. An independent method might be a little confusing, especially as the code becomes increasingly complicated. These functions can also use the local variables of the class as well, allowing a programmer to avoid cluttering the program with exceeedingly specific variables.</p>
        <p>We are just starting to use classes, of course, so there will doubtless be more that I just haven't learned yet.</p>
