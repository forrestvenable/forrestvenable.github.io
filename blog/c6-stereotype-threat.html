        <p>This week we learned a little about "stereotype threat." Stereotype threat is the name some researchers have given to a potential cause for why various ethnic, social, and cultural groups perform differently in in various endeavors. The hypothetical cause is that the increased stress of dealing with these stereotypes, along with self-identification with the stereotyped group results in a person actually performing worse than they ought to. For instance a woman might perform worse then men when a task is framed as a math problem than if they had to perform the same exact task in a neutral context.</p>
        <p>The mechanism of stereotype threat is unclear, but one hypothesis is that the stress of performing a task that one is told will be difficult is responsible. Likewise feeling unwelcome also appears to aggravate the effect. This makes a lot of sense, as someone who feels like they have to justify their presence has a lot more things on their mind than someone who is just performing the task, and is thus distracted.</p>
        <p>As a white, moderately well-to-do, cisgender male, the relevant stereotype is that visual design is a job for women (women are supposedly more artistic then men, and developers are supposedly exceptionally poor at it). I know I certainly had a lot of people tell me that I wasn't good at art, or who expressed surprise when I actually do a good job at it. Other than that, most of the stereotypes are actually in my favor with only a small portion of the population considering Asian-Americans better at programming than whites.</p>
        <p>According to wikipedia, simply being informed of the effect is sufficient to significantly reduce it, and having a warm and welcoming environment also mitigates it. The big thing is to not to remind people of such stereotypes (which is actually how all the studies created the effect). Considering that such discussions are off-topic and impolite to begin with, this shouldn't be very difficult.</p>
        <p>Incidentally there is similarly a small, but statistically significant, effect from what someone's name is.</p>
