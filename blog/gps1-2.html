        <span class="title">Pair Programming</span>
            <p>
                Two or more programmers working on code. Working together to not only collaborate
                but also split workload. This allows knowledge to be shared and increases efficiency.
                While one is coding, another can look up syntax specific information.

        <span class="title">Pair Programming Important to DBC</span>
            <p>
                It is important because helps people share knowledge and help develop an understanding
                of code standards and rationales for doing things. This also avoids the stereotype
                of a lone programmer hacking away at code in the night. In addition, it is good 
                practice for real world job positions for web developers.

            <p>
                Driver - Is the person who actually writing the code
            </p>
            <p>
                Navigator - Is the person who organizes the driver&#39;s effort and sets priorities.
