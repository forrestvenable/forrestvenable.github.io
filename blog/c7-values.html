        <p>This week's post is a continuation of the last's regarding "stereotype threat". Our task here is to express a number of our closely held values. I presume that this is to help adjust our perspective of ourselves as individuals rather than members of a group. I don't fully understand and this seems like a waste of time. With that said, here we go:</p>
        <p>The thing that makes me happiest is friendship, something that I feel like I have very little of these days. I had a number of very close friends at my college, and I attempted to live together with them for a short period. That ended poorly and I have not spoken with them since. I really want to make a number of good friends at Dev Bootcamp but once bitten twice shy.</p>
        <p>As for other values (which I am supposed to rate 1-5 based upon how much I have been pushing towards them? This makes no sense.) there is <ul><li>Integrity: 5</li><li>Honesty: 4</li><li>Intellectual Achievement: 2 (I no longer feel like pursuing intellectual excellence qua itself will make me happy but I continue to seek it regardless)</li><li>Mentorship: 3</li><li>Kindness: 4</li><li>Stability: 3</li></ul></p>
        <p>As for the last time I helped someone, I was asked to help someone install sqlite on their computer last week, and I essentially run tech support for my whole family.</p>
        <p>In the end, this was supposed to make me feel more confident, but has only raised more doubts. Dev Bootcamp and I appear to have somewhat different views on how things work, and calling attention to it only makes me more nervous. I know who I am, the real question is about Dev Bootcamp.</p>
