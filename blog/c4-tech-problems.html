        <p>For this week we are looking forward and learning about some of the problems facing the technology industry as a whole.</p>
        <p>Having done some research, the problem that keeps coming up is that technology companies keep viewing everything as a technological challenge, rather than trying to find the best tool for the job. If you are a manufacturer of hammers, then an awful lot of things look like nails, whether it is trying to alleviate some of poverty's effects by providing free internet (Google Fiber), preventing spying on consumers (by supporting ubiquitous encryption), or even just figuring out how to get your employees to work safely and efficiently (by using company buses)</p>
        <p>Unfortunately none of those solutions work very well, as they don't actually take into account the social part of the problem. Google Fiber ran into a lot of trouble expanding into poorer areas of Kansas City because Google wasn't working with community leaders, and so people had no idea what the benefits and costs actually were and so initially ignored it. Working on encryption helps keep things private, but that is a mere stopgap for political action, which is less forthcoming. Finally, company buses create a flashpoint for a topic that has been simmering for a while, namely whether technology employees are integrating into the larger society or are simply replacing it.</p>
        <p>The solution is at once quite simple, but also extremely difficult: to actually consult with those around you and cultivate a more inclusive perspective. This is at once extremely simple and incredibly hard. Simple because anyone can see what to do, and hard because it takes a huge amount of time, effort and resources to actually do. No one wants to act out of ignorance, but learning is not something that happens overnight. Worst of all, the places where improvement is most needed are the places where technology companies aren't even aware there is a problem. Spending outrageous amounts of resources to talk to people to solve something that doesn't even look like a problem sounds very difficult to justify indeed.</p>
