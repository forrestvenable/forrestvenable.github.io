Thoughts on Dev Bootcamps Culture
September 16, 2014

I recently watched this video (at http://vimeo.com/85001014) discussing the way that one of Dev Bootcamp's founders thinks of Dev Bootcamp's culture.

As I have not yet actually attended Dev Bootcamp in person, I obviously cannot corroborate what he says. What I will say is that the ideal that he presents is certainly a positive one, and one that I will try my best to uphold. I have found that my fellow cohort mates are very helpful and kind people and I am sure that I will, in time, make many great friends.

That said, ideals are one thing and reality is another, I am sure that everyone involved will have bad days where we really just want to get everything done with and don't feel like actually engaging with the challenges. I hope that such days are rare for the rest of my cohort and me, and that the material will be interesting and engaging.

I am not sure where this will go, but what I have seen so far is hopeful.
