  to copy and paste the blog posts from week 1 in there
  to make them pretty next week.

  For now, please replace the title, subtitle (if desired),
  and date with the text you would like. Markdown is pretty

Thoughts on Dev Bootcamps Culture
September 16, 2014

I recently watched this video (at http://vimeo.com/85001014) discussing the way that one of Dev Bootcamp's founders thinks of Dev Bootcamp's culture.

As I have not yet actually attended Dev Bootcamp in person, I obviously cannot corroborate what he says. What I will say is that the ideal that he presents is certainly a positive one, and one that I will try my best to uphold. I have found that my fellow cohort mates are very helpful and kind people and I am sure that I will, in time, make many great friends.

That said, ideals are one thing and reality is another, I am sure that everyone involved will have bad days where we really just want to get everything done with and don't feel like actually engaging with the challenges. I hope that such days are rare for the rest of my cohort and me, and that the material will be interesting and engaging.

I am not sure where this will go, but what I have seen so far is hopeful.
